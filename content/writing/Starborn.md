summary: Drafts on Starborn topic
---

This is a collection of drafts exploring the topic of possible Starborn societies of my Starfield **canon/fanon**.

*It is pure writing of my ideas, and is **not a mod.***

# Societies

Starborn are a crowd of elusive nature. Some of them are detached, frequently being chaotic and quite hostile, but all of them are not alike. Hovewer, while rarely, some of them find company in eachother's views and interests, therefore sort of a group is formed. This text would consider possible groups of Starborn that could exist, or could not - it is definitely difficult to tell and get lost like a tiny needle in a multiversally messy haybale.

So-called *Hidden Scientists* Starborn groups are rare to encounter. Some of them find peace in caves, some even do like the peace of a Creator's Temple, but they rarely pick abandoned modern man-made buildings to settle down, much prefering the peace of nature or familiar sight of a Creator's Temple interior.

They strive to research the essence of their powers, wanting to accuire answers to their multiversally-specific questions. Some of them do find clues, but the major flaw of that group type is being decentralized: they don't share their research, keeping everything inside a small introverted group, therefore the knowledge fades as they separate, either by death (which might be common, keeping in mind their nature to experiment) or by other kind of detachment, including a will to grow as a person further, so some of them leave the group willingly. Some of them do share the knowledge amongst their visited Universe, but as there is ever-growing self-culling binary-tree Universal structure, it can be considered pointless, if only they knew it. Those who share their knowledge usually do it right before the group becomes absent, whatever the reason might be; this leads to variants of unknown scriptures and unique inventions nobody knows how to power, scattered around a specific universe.
